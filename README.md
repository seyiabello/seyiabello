## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects

Here are my featured hands-on projects. Each repo includes documentation, configuration details, and screenshots of the process.  

- 🔒 [**Ubuntu Firewall Configuration with UFW**](https://github.com/seyiabello/ubuntu-firewall-ufw)  
  Configured UFW firewall rules on Ubuntu to enforce least-privilege security, blocked Telnet, allowed only essential services, and validated rules with **Nmap**.  

- 🛡️ [**Cybersecurity Home Lab – Penetration Testing & Defense**](https://github.com/seyiabello/cybersecurity-home-lab)  
  Built a VirtualBox lab with Ubuntu (target) & Kali (attacker). Ran **Nmap**, brute-forced SSH with **Hydra**, and captured packets with **Wireshark** to simulate attacker vs. defender workflows.  

- 🌐 [**Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark**](https://github.com/seyiabello/network-traffic-analysis-wireshark)  
  Captured and analyzed 500+ packets across protocols, applied Wireshark filters, and reconstructed traffic streams to identify SSDP broadcasts and HTTP payloads.
